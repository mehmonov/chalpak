# Installation

This guide provides instructions on how to install the Chalpak web framework.

## Installation Options

There are several ways to install and start using Chalpak:

-   **Using pip (Recommended):** The easiest and most common way to install Chalpak is via `pip`, the Python package installer.
-   **Cloning the Repository:** For development or to access the latest (potentially unstable) features, you can clone the Chalpak repository from GitHub.
-   **Using a Project Template (Coming Soon):** We're working on providing a project template that you can use to quickly bootstrap a new Chalpak project with a pre-configured structure. 

## Method 1: Installation via pip (Recommended)

**Step 1: Install Chalpak**

Install Chalpak using `pip`:

```bash
pip install chalpak
```
**Step 3: Verify Installation**

Verify that Chalpak was installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
chalpak --version
```
You should see the installed version of Chalpak printed in the console.

## Method 2: Cloning the Repository (For Development)
Use this method if you want to contribute to Chalpak development or need the very latest (potentially unstable) version.

**Step 1: Clone the Chalpak Repository**
Clone the Chalpak repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehmonov/chalpak
```
**Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory**

Change your current directory to the newly cloned Chalpak folder:

```bash
cd chalpak
```

**Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment**

It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
```
**Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment**

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Method 3: Using a Project Template (Coming Soon)

    Note: This feature is not yet available but is planned for a future release.

We're working on a project template to simplify bootstrapping new Chalpak applications. This template will provide a basic project structure, example code, and configuration to get you started quickly.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation, please check the following:

-  Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
-  Ensure that pip is up to date (pip install --upgrade pip).
-  If using a virtual environment, verify that it's activated.
-  Consult the Chalpak repository's issue tracker or community forums for solutions to common problems.

We're here to help if you run into any problems. Happy coding with Chalpak!
