## Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you quickly get started with Chalpak, set up a simple application, and understand the basic file structure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

-   Python 3.7 or higher
-   pip (Python package installer)

## Creating Your First Chalpak Application

Let's create a simple Chalpak application with two routes: one that returns JSON data and another that renders an HTML template.

**Step 1: Create Project Directory**

First, create a new directory for your project:
```bash
mkdir my_chalpak_app
cd my_chalpak_app
```

**Step 2: Create main.py**

Create a file named main.py in your project directory and add the following code:

```bash
from chalpak.app import Chalpak

app = Chalpak(templates="templates")

@app.get("/salom/{name}")
async def salom(request, name):
    return {"message": f"Salom, {name}!"}

@app.get("/html/{name}")
async def html_page(request, name):
    return app.render("index.html", {"request": request, "name": name})

app.run()
```
