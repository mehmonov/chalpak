## Project Overview

Chalpak aims to be a lightweight, flexible, and easy-to-learn alternative to existing Python web frameworks. It leverages modern Python features like type hints and async/await to make your code more readable, maintainable, and efficient.

**Key Goals:**

-   **Fast to Code:** Increase development speed with an intuitive API and minimal boilerplate.
-   **Fast to Run:** Deliver high performance thanks to Starlette and asynchronous programming.
-   **Automatic API Docs:** Generate interactive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger and ReDoc) automatically from your code.
-   **Data Validation:** Use Pydantic for robust data validation and serialization.
-   **Easy to Learn:** Designed with simplicity and a gentle learning curve in mind.
-   **Extensible:** Support for plugins and middleware to customize and enhance functionality.

## Key Features

| Feature                      | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FastAPI-like API**         | Similar developer experience to FastAPI, making it easy to transition or learn if you're familiar with FastAPI.                                |
| **Asynchronous Support**     | Leverage `async` and `await` for non-blocking, concurrent request handling.                                                                   |
| **Type Hinting**           | Use Python type hints for improved code readability, maintainability, and automatic data validation.                                              |
| **Pydantic Integration**     | Define data models and perform data validation using Pydantic.                                                                                  |
| **Automatic API Docs**      | Generate interactive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger and ReDoc) from your code and type hints.                                            |
| **Dependency Injection**    | Powerful and easy-to-use dependency injection system.                                                                                          |
| **Middleware Support**       | Add custom middleware to modify requests and responses.                                                                                         |
| **Testing Utilities**        | Built-in testing utilities to simplify writing tests for your application.                                                                       |
| **Built on Starlette**      | Benefit from the performance and features of the Starlette ASGI toolkit.                                                                      |
